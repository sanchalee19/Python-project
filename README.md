**GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE ANALYSIS**

**OBJECTIVE**

To analyze historical global temperature anomalies from 1880 to the present, using the NASA GISS Surface Temperature dataset, in order to identify long-term trends in global warming. The aim is to explore how global temperatures have deviated from the baseline over time, understand the patterns of seasonal and annual temperature changes, and assess the progression of global climate change. The project will include data visualization to highlight significant periods of warming and cooling, and will investigate the correlation between these anomalies and key global events or natural phenomena.
